<h1 style="padding-top: 64px; padding-bottom: 18px;"> Consulting &amp; Workshops</h1>

We help diverse and inclusive teams examine challenges and opportunities to surface better ideas and solutions that make a lasting, positive impact. To this end, we work with internal and external partners to develop, test, organize, and encourage innovative projects with the goal of fostering a culture of innovation within the City of Austin.

## Consulting
- **Collaboration Design:** Your project idea probably involves various stakeholders. What’s the best way to engage and involve through the problem solving process? Let us help you design a path for collaboration through crowdsourcing or co-creation. For example, when Austin Resource Recovery was stuck with the challenge of plateaued rates of residential recycling , we used a crowd-consulting methodology to tap community insights into ways in which we might increase residential recycling. The result was more than 1,300 responses organized into 11 insights that directly informed leadership decisions.
- **Coaching and Mentoring:** Sometimes you just need an unbiased thinking partner with an outside perspective on your project idea. Our staff is happy to be that partner. Each coaching/mentoring session gives you the opportunity to talk through any challenges you might be facing with your project. Together we can brainstorm how to overcome obstacles, realize opportunities, and keep your project on track.
- **Outside Expertise:** Your project might benefit from outside expertise. Innovation projects often require unique or specialized expertise such as developers, data science, or design. Such projects often benefit from generalist participants with a unique perspective on the challenge or opportunity. The Innovation Office can facilitate access to expertise in two ways:
 - Our Technology, Design, and Innovation Fellows program will leverage the talent of change-makers within our Austin community to team up with government experts to help refine, prototype, and develop selected Innovation Fund projects to achieve a lasting positive impact.
 - If you want to use your project opportunity to fully embed user experience design, service design, or complexity navigation into your Department's innovation team, we can facilitate an outside contractor for capacity building to plus-up your capability.


## Workshops
The Office of Innovation offers several different workshops focused on building a foundation for project success, and then facilitating teams through a process to solve a problem. We’ll work with project champions to customize a workshop to your needs. Below are descriptions of some of the workshops others have found valuable:

- **Innovation 101:** Innovation 101 is about laying the right foundation for your team to work together to solve a problem. This workshop will calibrate your team with a common language, skills, and behaviors to reduce the “storming” phase that often happens within teams tackling a complex challenge. It also introduces the team to the strategic co-creation process--a general approach to working through the uncertainty that accompanies innovation projects. We’ll also equip you with the tools and collaboration technologies to be successful. This workshop is valued at $600.
- **Clarifying the Challenge/Opportunity:** Have you ever asked yourself, “What don't we know? What might we have overlooked or assumed?” When we don’t fully understand all aspects of a challenge--the people involved, the history, constraints, how it connects to other challenges--the solution often fails. Taking just a bit of time to clarify and frame a challenge or opportunity before we begin formulating ideas pays dividends when it comes time for solutions. The Innovation Office can facilitate a team to gain this clarity, using multiple methods: design research, strategic co-creation, visual sense-making, and data visualization. Let our experienced facilitators lead your team through the process so you can focus on the problem.
- **Prototyping:** By running a small-scale version of a program, project, or service, we help you work through the on-the-ground realities that make change difficult. Prototyping can be anything from a simple storyboard, to a wireframe diagram, to front-end web development, to role-playing a new service interaction. Prototyping helps mitigate risk by building evidence required for full scale implementation. The Innovation Team also uses tools like the Business Model Canvas, to help your team estimate the long-term business requirements that will make your project idea sustainable.
- **Pitching and Storytelling:** No matter how solid your idea is, if you can’t effectively tell your story, you’ll have a hard time gaining support for your idea. This session will help you present your project in a compelling way when you recruit others to the team, gain commitment from leaders, and boast your results.
